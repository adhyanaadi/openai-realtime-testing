# Governance Strategy for Tools & Agent Interactions

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of Governance
The primary purpose of this governance strategy is to ensure the secure, reliable, compliant, and ethical use of both integrated MCP (Multi-Capability Protocol) Tools and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) interactions within the Realtime Agent Interaction Backend system. It aims to mitigate risks, maintain data integrity, and ensure that all components operate within defined operational and ethical boundaries.

### Scope
This document covers governance aspects related to:
-   **MCP Tool Onboarding and Management:** The lifecycle of tools that the backend agent can directly invoke, including their proposal, review, integration, and ongoing monitoring.
-   **A2A Interaction Policies:** The rules and protocols governing how the backend agent interacts with other agents, and how other agents might interact with it (if A2A server capabilities are enabled).

## 2. MCP Tool Governance

This section outlines the processes and considerations for managing MCP Tools available to the backend agent.

### a. Tool Onboarding Process

A structured onboarding process is crucial for introducing new tools.

1.  **Proposal/Request:**
    *   A requester (e.g., development team, business unit) submits a formal proposal for any new tool.
    *   The proposal must include:
        *   **Purpose and Justification:** The business need or capability the tool addresses.
        *   **Functionality:** Detailed description of what the tool does.
        *   **Provider:** Whether it's custom-built internally or a third-party/external service.
        *   **Intended Use Cases:** How the agent is expected to use this tool.
        *   **Data Requirements:** What data the tool accesses or processes.

2.  **Security Review:**
    *   **Source Code Analysis (if custom-built):** Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and manual code review for vulnerabilities, insecure coding practices, and logic flaws.
    *   **Permissions Analysis:** Detailed assessment of the data and systems the tool needs to access. Principle of Least Privilege must be applied. Document any credentials required (these will be managed via secure environment variables or a secrets manager).
    *   **Input/Output Validation:** Verify that the tool implements robust validation for all inputs it receives and outputs it produces to prevent injection attacks, data leakage, or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Dependency Check:** For custom tools, scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `pip-audit`, Snyk, Dependabot).
    *   **External Tools/Services:**
        *   **Vendor Reputation & Trust:** Assess the provider's security posture, certifications (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001), and data handling policies.
        *   **API Security:** Review the security of the external API (authentication, authorization, encryption).
        *   **Data Privacy & Residency:** Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations if the tool processes PII or sensitive data.

3.  **Functional Review:**
    *   **Performance & Reliability:** Test the tool for expected performance under load and its reliability. For external tools, review vendor SLAs.
    *   **Accuracy & Correctness:** Validate that the tool produces accurate and correct results for its intended function.
    *   **Business Need Alignment:** Confirm the tool genuinely meets the proposed business need effectively.

4.  **Compliance & Ethical Review:**
    *   **Data Handling:** Ensure the tool's data processing activities comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA if applicable).
    *   **Ethical Considerations:** Assess potential ethical implications, such as:
        *   Bias in AI-driven tools.
        *   Potential for misuse leading to harmful outcomes.
        *   Transparency in tool usage (e.g., should the user be aware a specific tool is being used?).

5.  **Risk Assessment & Mitigation:**
    *   Summarize identified risks (security, functional, compliance, ethical).
    *   Propose and document mitigation strategies for each significant risk.

6.  **Approval/Rejection:**
    *   A designated governance body (e.g., Security Lead, Architecture Review Board, or a dedicated Tool Governance Committee) reviews the proposal and all review findings.
    *   A formal decision (approved, rejected, or approved with conditions) is recorded.

7.  **Integration & Testing:**
    *   If approved, the tool is integrated into the backend:
        *   Define its `MCPToolDefinition` in `backend/models/tool_definition.py` or a relevant tool definition file.
        *   Update `required_credentials` and `required_role` fields in the definition accurately.
        *   Register the tool in `MCPToolService._register_initial_tools()` (or a future dynamic registration mechanism).
    *   Conduct thorough integration testing, including security and functional tests within the agent ecosystem.

8.  **Documentation:**
    *   Document the tool's purpose, how it's configured (including environment variables for credentials), its input/output schema, expected behavior, and any usage guidelines or limitations for the LLM.
    *   Update the main `backend/README.md` to list the new tool.

### b. Ongoing Monitoring & Review

-   **Periodic Reviews:** Regularly (e.g., annually or bi-annually) review active tools for continued relevance, security posture, and compliance with current policies and regulations.
-   **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor tool invocation latency, error rates, and success rates using the observability framework (logs, metrics, traces).
-   **Vulnerability Management:** Continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities in tool dependencies or external services.
-   **Decommissioning Process:** Define a clear process for retiring tools that are no longer needed, are insecure, or non-compliant. This includes removing them from the registry, code, and LLM prompts.

### c. Tool Manifest & Registry

-   The `MCPToolRegistry` in `MCPToolService` currently serves as the runtime manifest of available tools.
-   **Future Enhancement:** Consider a persistent, version-controlled store for `MCPToolDefinition`s (e.g., a dedicated database table, YAML/JSON files in a Git repository). This would:
    *   Provide a clearer audit history of tool changes.
    *   Allow for easier management and versioning of tool definitions.
    *   Potentially enable dynamic loading/unloading of tools without application restarts (if the registry supports it).

## 3. A2A Interaction Policies

These policies govern how the backend agent interacts with other agents (as a client) and how it might expose its own capabilities to other agents (as a server).

### a. Trust & Authentication

-   **Mutual Authentication (for internal/trusted A2A):**
    *   When communicating with other internal backend services or highly trusted partner agents, mTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security) is the preferred method. Both services authenticate each other using client and server certificates signed by a common private CA. (Refer to `backend/docs/mtls_strategy.md`).
-   **Token-Based Authentication (for external A2A):**
    *   When interacting with external third-party agents, standard API security practices like OAuth 2.0 (client credentials or other appropriate flows) or API keys should be used by the `A2ACommunicationService` to authenticate to the target agent. Credentials for these should be managed securely.
-   **Authorization for Incoming A2A (if backend acts as A2A server):**
    *   If this backend exposes its own A2A endpoints, incoming requests from other agents must be authenticated (e.g., mTLS, OAuth Bearer token).
    *   The authenticated calling agent's identity (e.g., client ID, service name from mTLS certificate) must be used to authorize access to specific tasks or resources, potentially using an RBAC-like mechanism.

### b. Data Sharing & Minimization

-   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only share the minimum data necessary for the delegated task. Avoid exposing excessive internal data or context.
-   **Data Sensitivity Levels:** Classify data that might be shared via A2A interactions (e.g., PII, confidential, public). Apply appropriate security measures (encryption, masking, consent management) based on sensitivity.
-   **Compliance:** Ensure all A2A data sharing complies with relevant data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). This includes considerations for data residency and cross-border data transfers if applicable.

### c. Capability Discovery & Schema Adherence

-   **A2A Agent Registry (Conceptual):** As outlined in `backend/docs/a2a_strategy.md`, a dedicated registry service is the ideal way for agents to dynamically discover each other's capabilities, supported tasks, endpoint URLs, and input/output schemas.
-   **Strict Schema Adherence:** Agents must strictly adhere to the defined `input_schema` and `output_schema` for A2A tasks.
    *   **Client-Side Validation:** The `A2ACommunicationService` (or the calling agent) should validate its outgoing `A2ATaskRequest` against the target agent's published input schema (if available via the registry).
    *   **Server-Side Validation:** An agent exposing A2A tasks must rigorously validate all incoming `A2ATaskRequest` inputs against its defined schema before processing. It should also ensure its responses conform to its published `output_schema`.

### d. Responsibility & Accountability

-   **Task Ownership:** Clearly define which agent is ultimately responsible for the outcome of a task, especially if it's part of a multi-agent chain. Typically, the agent that initiated the top-level user request holds overall responsibility, but sub-task responsibility lies with the agent performing it.
-   **Audit Trails:** Ensure comprehensive audit trails cover all A2A interactions. Logs should include:
    *   Calling agent ID, called agent ID, task name, request ID.
    *   Timestamp of request and response.
    *   Status of the interaction (success, failure, error codes).
    *   A summary or hash of inputs/outputs (avoiding logging sensitive data directly in main audit logs if possible, or using a separate secure log).

### e. Error Handling & Resilience

-   **Standardized Error Codes/Messages:** Encourage the use of standardized error codes and response structures for A2A failures to facilitate programmatic error handling.
-   **Client-Side Resilience:** The `A2ACommunicationService` already implements retries for transient errors. Consider adding circuit breaker patterns for more robust handling of frequently failing target agents.
-   **Fallbacks:** Define fallback strategies if a delegated task fails (e.g., try a different agent, attempt the task with an internal MCP tool if possible, or inform the user with a clear message).

### f. Security Review for External Agents

-   If the backend needs to integrate with new third-party agents not controlled by our organization, a security review process similar to that for external MCP tools should be applied. This includes assessing the external agent's security posture, data handling policies, and API security.

### g. Rate Limiting & Throttling

-   **Outgoing Calls:** The `A2ACommunicationService` should be mindful of not overwhelming other agents. Implement client-side rate limiting if necessary, especially if calling public APIs.
-   **Incoming Calls (if backend acts as A2A server):** Implement rate limiting and throttling on any exposed A2A endpoints to protect the backend from abuse or denial-of-service from other agents.

## 4. Governance Oversight

-   **Formation of a Governance Body/Role:**
    *   Consider forming a small, cross-functional working group (e.g., including representatives from Security, Engineering, Product, Legal/Compliance).
    *   Alternatively, assign oversight responsibility to an existing body like a Security Council or Architecture Review Board.
-   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Reviewing and approving new tool onboarding requests and A2A integrations.
    *   Periodically reviewing existing tools and A2A policies.
    *   Maintaining and updating governance documentation.
    *   Making decisions on escalated issues related to tool/A2A security, compliance, or ethics.
    *   Promoting awareness and adherence to these governance policies.

This governance strategy is a living document and should be reviewed and updated regularly as the system evolves, new risks emerge, and best practices change.

# It's good practice to set environment variables for tests if they differ from dev/prod
# For example, you might set a specific OPENAI_API_KEY for testing, or a test DATABASE_URL
# These can be set in your CI environment, or locally via a .env file loaded by python-dotenv
# (which is already in requirements.txt and loaded in security.py and potentially database.py for defaults)
# If using pytest-dotenv, you can specify .env files here:
# dotenv_files = .env.test
# However, since python-dotenv is already used, ensure it loads the correct .env file at runtime,
# or set environment variables directly in the shell/CI where pytest is run.

# Example marker for slow tests (if any)
# markers =
#     slow: marks tests as slow to run

# Example to ignore certain warnings if necessary
# filterwarnings =
#     ignore::DeprecationWarning
#     ignore::UserWarning
